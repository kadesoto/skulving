Skulving
========

Memory lab ingress gateway.

Skulving is a prototype currently residing in the Memory Lab in the Washington University Department of Psychology. Construct him following the Charlie's Bear instructions from Make Magazine: http://makezine.com/projects/charlies-rfid-teddy-bear/

Then, upload the custom code here. The .wav files are not currently included... but they could be given enough interest.

Let me know if you have questions or concerns.
