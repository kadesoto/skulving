Skulving
========

Memory lab ingress gateway.

Skulving is a prototype currently residing in the Memory Lab in the Washington University Department of Psychology. Construct his mechanical parts following the Charlie's Bear instructions from Make Magazine: http://makezine.com/projects/charlies-rfid-teddy-bear/

Attach the Arduino running the .ino file to a Raspberry Pi running the attached Python script.

Let me know if you have questions or concerns. This is obviously an alpha project.
