Skulving
========

Skeletal unified laboratory virtual ingress notification gateway.

Skulving is a prototype currently residing in the Memory Lab in the Washington University Department of Psychology. Construct his mechanical parts following the Charlie's Bear instructions from Make Magazine: http://makezine.com/projects/charlies-rfid-teddy-bear/. You can leave out the part with the Wave Shield, as that is no longer implemented in this construction (i.e., the only addition is the RFID reader).

Attach the Arduino running the .ino file to a Raspberry Pi running the attached Python script.

Let me know if you have questions or concerns. This is obviously an alpha project. You can also visit Skulving on the web at http://technimentis.com/skulving/.
